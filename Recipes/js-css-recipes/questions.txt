What are tags and attributes in HTML?
    Tags are the primary component of the HTML that defines how the
    content will be structured/ formatted, whereas Attributes are used 
    along with the HTML tags to define the characteristics of the 
    element. For example, <p align=” center”>Interview questions</p>, 
    in this the ‘align’ is the attribute using which we will align the 
    paragraph to show in the center of the view

A Block-level element occupies the entire horizontal space of its 
parent element (container), and vertical space equal to the height
of its contents, thereby creating a "block". Browsers typically
display the block-level element with a newline both before and 
after the element.

What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ 
attribute of HTML elements?
    Multiple elements in HTML can have the same class value, whereas a 
    value of id attribute of one element cannot be associated with
    another HTML element

Describe HTML layout structure.
Every web page has different components to display the intended 
content and a specific UI. But still, there are few things which 
are templated and are globally accepted way to structure the web 
page, such as:

    <header>: Stores the starting information about the web page.
    <footer>: Represents the last section of the page.
    <nav>: The navigation menu of the HTML page.
    <article>: It is a set of information.
    <section>: It is used inside the article block to define the basic 
    structure of a page.
    <aside>: Sidebar content of the page


In how many ways can we position an HTML element? 
Or what are the permissible values of the position attribute?
There are mainly 7 values of position attribute that can be used to 
position an HTML element:
    static: Default value. Here the element is positioned according to 
    the normal flow of the document.
    absolute: Here the element is positioned relative to its parent 
    element. The final position is determined by the values of left, right, top, bottom.
    fixed: This is similar to absolute except here the elements are 
    positioned relative to the <html> element.
    relative: Here the element is positioned according to the normal 
    flow of the document and positioned relative to its original/ normal position.
    initial: This resets the property to its default value.
    inherit: Here the element inherits or takes the property of its 
    parent

In how many ways you can display HTML elements?
    inline: Using this we can display any block-level element as an 
    inline element. The height and width attribute values of the element
    will not affect.
    block: using this, we can display any inline element as a 
    block-level element. 
    inline-block: This property is similar to inline, except by using 
    the display as inline-block, we can actually format the element using height and width values.
    flex: It displays the container and element as a flexible structure. It follows flexbox property.
    inline-flex: It displays the flex container as an inline element 
    while its content follows the flexbox properties.
    grid: It displays the HTML elements as a grid container.
    none: Using this property we can hide the HTML element.
