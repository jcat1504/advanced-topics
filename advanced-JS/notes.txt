COMPILER VS INTERPRETER
COMPILER: Transform code written in a high level programming language into machine code, at once, before program runs

* Will run code faster because it will only loop once
*Has optimization, even though it starts off slower

INTERPRETER; converts each high level program statement one by one, into machine code, during program running
    -Babel: JS compiler that takes modern JS code and returns browser compatible JS(old JS code)
    -TypeScript: Superset of JS that compiles down to JS
    
 *Easy to get up and running
 *Can get slow with repeated code
 
 *V8 engines have JIT compilers, which is best of both worlds
 
 *IS JAVASCRIPT AN INTERPRETATED LANGUAGE?*
 Well--depends on the implementation! Most of its performances and optimization factor depends on the engine it is supported by
 -First of all, JS engines(or any other language engines) which translate our code for computers to understand are based on
 interpreter or compilers
 -Since we also have compliers in the engine to optimize code, it is not really an interpreted language
 
 *CALLSTACKS VS MEMORY HEAPS*
 *MEMORY HEAP: Place to store/write code. Place to allocate memory, use memory, release memory
 *CALL STACK: Keep track of where we are in the code. FILO
 -So... for every function execution, a new execution context is created, which gets popped into call stack, and is how
 JS thread learns which environment to take instruction from and execute.
 
 3 COMMON THINGS THAT CAN CAUSE MEMORY LEAKS:
 1.) Global Variables
 2.) Event Listeners
 3.) Set intervals - like when you are referencing objects, it will be running and running cause it isn't collected by garbage collector
 
 *MEMORY LIFESTYLE*
 1. Allocate memory you need
 2. Use the allocated memory(read, write)
 3. Release the allocated memory when it is not needed anymore
 
 *WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH ASYNCHRONOUS CODE*
 Not great at handling long running tasks! So if you have an alert button, you can't scroll or click til you click on button
 
Lexical: related to the words or vocabulary of a language
Where the words were written and their location 
Think of it this way: each global execution context shows a new world of lexican environment

for each function, it creates a lexical environment 
In javascript, our lexical scope(available data + variables where the function was defined)
determines our available variables. Not where the function is called, which is dynamic scope.

*EXECUTION CONTEXT: An abstract oncept of an environment where JS code is evaluated and executed
*Types: 
    -Global Execution Context: Default execution context. Creates global obj(usually the window) + sets value of this===global obj
    Can only be one global executional context in program
    -Functional Execution Context: everytime a function is invoked, a brand new exectution contect is created for that function
    -Eval function execution context: code executed by eval function. we don't use this really.
    

Hoisting:the behavior of moving the variables or function declarations
to the top of their respective environments during compilation phase 
vaiables are partially hoisted--hoist the variable but not the right side
^^Calling the variable before it is declared reads it as undefined
function declarations are hoisted 
Hoisting is making space in memory to allocate functions or var keywords
to make sure that the Js engine is ready for execution 
with variables, can only hoist var 

//function expression 
var sing2 = function(){
    console.log('uhh la la')
}
//^^going to be run after it is defined because it is not hoisted 

//function declaration 
function sing() {
    console.log('ohhh la la la')
}

*FUNCTION SCOPE VS BLOCK SCOPE*
*FUNCTION SCOPE: Variable is defined and visible only in function. cannot access outside of function
*BLOCK SCOPE: usually within if, switch conditions or for/while loops or {} functions
    -const or let will define block scope variables 
    
*this: the object that the function is a property of 
    *this refers to whatever is left of the dot 
    *this avoids DRY
  WHY IS THIS SO IMPORTANT?*
  1. gives methods access to their objects
  2. executes same code for multiple objects
  
-In JS, our lexical scope(available data and variables where function was defined) determines our available variables. not where the 
function was called/dynamic scopes
-For this keyword, doesn't matter where variable is written, it matters where the function is called
*arrow functions are lexically scoped
    -it will not bound to window object if you place your var in an object itself!
    
*CALL, APPLY, BIND()*
-call(): literally invokes function with ();
    can also use call on a function from another object
*call and apply go hand in hand. apply just takes elements in array. good for borrowing methods from objs
*bind(): will return a new function with certain context and parameters. useful to call functions later on with certain context
or certain 'this' keyword

*BIND AND CURRYING*
*currying: process in functional programming which we can transform a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of nesting
functions. returns a new function that expects the next argument inline
    -keep returning functions until arguments are done
  COMES IN HANDY WHEN:
   1.) you want to write little code modules that can be reused and configured with ease
   2.) to avoid frequently calling a function with the same argument 
   
 EXAMPLE OF CURRYING
    function multiply(a,b) {
        return a*b }
 let multiplyByTwo = multiply.bind(this, 2)
 console.log(multiplyByTwo(4)) => 8
 
 *CONTEXT VS SCOPE*
 Context- Object based
 Scope - Function based
 *Scope: pertains to the variable access of a function when it is invoked and is unique to each invocation 
 *Context: Always the value of this keyword, which is reference to the object that "owns" the currently executing code 
 *Null: absense of value * undefined absense of definition

 *Primitive: Represents a single value 
 *Array.isArray(): will check if element is actually an array 

 *PASS BY VALUE VS PASS BY REFERENCE*
 -In JS, all function arguments are always pass by value- which means that JS copies values of the variables that you 
 pass to a function into local variables
Any changes you make to the local variables inside the function does not affect the arguments that you passed in 

ie. function square(x) {
    x = x * x;
}
var y = 10;
square(y) =>no effect. this is pass by value 

*PASS BY REFERENCE*
let obj1 = { name: 'Yao', password: '123'}
let obj2 = obj1;
obj2.password = 'easypeasy'; <-- which also applies to obj1

*WAYS OF CLONING*
*object.assign(): copies all enumerable own properties from one or more sourced objects to a target object 
let obj - {a: 'a', b: 'b', c:'c'};
let clone = object.assign({}, obj);
                        target  source

let clone2 = {...obj} <--spread operator will also make a duplicate 

*DEEP COPY/CLONE VS SHALLOW CLONE*
*DEEP CLONE: Recursively clones all nested objects 
*SHALLOW CLONE: does not copy nested objects 

*TYPE COERCION: the process of converting value from one type to another. 1==='1', int to string 
*in conclusion always use ===

*STATICALLY TYPED LANGUAGES VS DYNAMICALLY TYPED LANGUAGES*
*STATIC: 
-var is known at compile time 
-a lot of trivial bugs caught before development 
-type checking 

*DYNAMIC: 
-if type is associated with runtime, values can be typed quicker 
-type checking at run time as opposed to compile time 

*WEAKLY VS STRONGLY TYPED*
-JS is weakly typed language as in: 
var a = "booya!"
a + 17="booya!17" <--can add other types to strings and so on and so forth 
*Java will give out an error because adding two diff primitive values is a no no*
