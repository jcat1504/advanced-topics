//if you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree
//bfs

//if the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
//bfs? dfs will take a real long time with super deep trees

//if the tree is very wide
//dfs. bfs will need too much memory. 
//it gotta keep track of nodes in current level(queue)

//if solutions are frequent but located deep into the tree
//dfs

//determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
//dfs

//finding the shortest path
